Up until now we have only inserted documents into our collection. Let's take a look at how we can update and remove them by interacting with the user interface.

## Step 4.1: Add Checkbox

First, we need to add a `<checkbox>` element to our `Task` component.
 
> Be sure to add the `readOnly` attribute since we are not using `onChange` to update the state.
 
> We also have to force our `checked` prop to a `boolean` since React understands that an `undefined` value as inexistent, therefore causing the component to switch from uncontrolled to a controlled one.

> You are also invited to experient and see how the app behaves for learning purposes.

Now we can update our task document toggling its state from `checked: false` to `checked: true` and vice-versa.

## Step 4.2: Add Delete Button

We can remove our task with just a few lines of code.

## Step 4.3: Add Styling

Our user interface up until this point has looked quite ugly. Let's add some basic styling which will serve as the foundation for a more professional looking app.

First, let's install the `classnames` package which helps us manage conditional styling:

```shell script
npm i classnames
```

{{{ diffStep 4.3 files="package.json" noTitle=true}}}

If our task is `checked` then the respective class will be applied to it.

{{{ diffStep 4.3 files="imports/ui/Task.jsx" noTitle=true}}}

Let's add proper classes to our parent elements.

Finally, we add the CSS styling which will normalize and differentiate our checked tasks visually.

Now we have a proper style foundation, nothing fancy, but we have the right semantics in place.
